       " 'i got my xti last year and had the same questions. after much reading and many classes ... i can tell you that the lens mount on the rebel is the same mount as the canon film slr cameras. in fact from what i have read it uses the same lens mount as cameras that go back like 15 years. look for lenses that work with \"ef\" mounts. if you are looking at portraits ... try 100mm i have heard good and bad about all of the different lens types, is, usm, l etc ... so i think it is dependent on your style, how you will be using the photos, what type of pictures you will be taking, how much money you want to spend and how picky you are. i think the best advice i could give is to find someone who is where you wannabe with your photography and see what he uses otherwise you will be getting all sorts of advice from peopole who may not even be into the same photograpy as you. some good advice i got last year was to visit a true camera store and see the lenses up close. maybe ask for a demonstration. if you go during a slow time the salesman will have more time to talk with you about the lenses and hopefully you will determine that he knows what he is talking about and listen to his advice? once you have a good idea of what you want ... then check on-line for a deal :o) if you feel that you have gone as far as you can go with your current lens ... i suggest moving up to one of the 75-300 lenses. since i do not personally own any of them (yet) i cannot rate them for you :o( i use my camera for everything from web site images to poster size prints. i have taken awesome action shots, wonderful portraits, great close ups of flowers, etc with my rebel xti! i\\'ve spent almost a year with the original lens. i imagine that\\'s not what you wanna hear ... cuz when i first got my camera i wanted alll of the lenses ;o) and accessories! i think waiting has made me a better informed consumer. it isnt the lens necessarily that makes the picture .... but the user ;o) if you have photoshop the 55mm is better than you think ... cuz you can crop the pictures (they are huge on the largest setting) ... remember that the resolution of your image is only going to be as good as the resolution of your printer. i\\'m sure everyone has an opinion on the lenses ... only you can know for sure which one is right for you. some things you can purchase if you dont go with the l series ;o) ... polarizer filter uv filter flash more memory spare battery tripod monopod wireless remote i hope you come back and review whatever lens you decide on!!',\n",
